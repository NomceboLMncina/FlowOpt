# Inpiration

This project was inspired by my background in industrial engineering, where efficient workflow management is crucial for productivity. Recognizing the need for a customizable in-house solution, I wanted to develop an application that could adapt to our specific operational requirements. FlowOpt was born from the vision of creating a flexible tool that simplifies time management, enhances task delegation, and evolves alongside our workplace needsâ€”eliminating the limitations of off-the-shelf software. By integrating features like workflow visualization and real-time task tracking, the app empowers teams to optimize processes dynamically, bridging the gap between industrial engineering principles and practical, day-to-day execution.

# 3 Key Features
![SC1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c4c1ec9-1981-4cb9-9fd4-cb97d42b4ee4)

Login/Signup: Individuals are able to create personal accounts especially within a company as this app was created for such a setting. Supervisors may have it as a tracking system for projects they may have delegated to team members and this details how long, what project and when it was assigned to them.

Workflow Visualization: Workflow efficiency is represented in visualization graph so as to easily make analysis of proper time management whilst doing taks. 
Tasks are listed at the bottom, with a feature of enabling reminders from 24hrs before due date for longer projects, and an hour reminder for daily short projects.
